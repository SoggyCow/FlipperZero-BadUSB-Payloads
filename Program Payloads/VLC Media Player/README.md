# VLC Media Player Installation Script for Flipper Zero

Author: SoggyCow  
License: MIT

## Overview

This script automates the installation of [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/), a lightweight, open-source multimedia platform, via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows systems. Using Flipper Zeroâ€™s **BadUSB** feature with DuckyScript, it simulates keystrokes to open an elevated Command Prompt and silently install VLC.

> Note: Chocolatey must be pre-installed. Run the Chocolatey setup script first if needed.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Prepare the Script
- Save as: `install_vlc.txt`
- Format: UTF-8 plain text

### 2. Upload to Flipper
- Connect Flipper Zero via USB or Bluetooth.
- Use **qFlipper** or **Flipper Mobile App**.
- Transfer to: `SD Card/badusb/`.

### 3. Execute on Host Machine
- On Flipper: Navigate to `Main Menu > Bad USB > install_vlc.txt`.
- Ensure USB mode is active.
- Connect to the target Windows machine and press **Run**.

The script will:
- Open the Run dialog (`Win + R`).
- Launch an elevated Command Prompt (`cmd` with `CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER`).
- Execute: `choco install vlc -y`.

## Installation Verification

VLC installs silently if:
- Chocolatey is installed.
- An internet connection is active.
- Administrative privileges are granted.

- **OS**: Windows 10/11
- **Chocolatey**: Must be pre-installed

## Technical Notes

- **Chocolatey Dependency**: Requires Chocolatey to be pre-installed.
