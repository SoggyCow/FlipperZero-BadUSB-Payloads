# Wireshark Installation Script for Flipper Zero

Author: SoggyCow  
License: MIT

## Overview

This script automates the installation of [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), a powerful network protocol analyzer, via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows systems. Using Flipper Zeroâ€™s **BadUSB** feature with DuckyScript, it opens an elevated Command Prompt and silently installs Wireshark.

> Note: Chocolatey must be pre-installed on the target system.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Save the Script
- Filename: `install_wireshark.txt`
- Format: UTF-8 plain text

### 2. Upload to Flipper
- Connect Flipper Zero via USB or Bluetooth.
- Use **qFlipper** or **Flipper Mobile App**.
- Transfer to: `SD Card/badusb/`.

### 3. Run the Script
- On Flipper: Navigate to `Main Menu > Bad USB > install_wireshark.txt`.
- Ensure USB mode is active.
- Connect to the target Windows machine and press **Run**.

The script will:
- Open the Run dialog (`Win + R`).
- Launch an elevated Command Prompt (`cmd` with `CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER`).
- Execute: `choco install wireshark -y`.

## Installation Verification

Wireshark installs silently if:
- Chocolatey is installed.
- Administrative privileges are available.
- An internet connection is active.
