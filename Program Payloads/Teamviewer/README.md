## Overview

This script automates the installation of [TeamViewer](https://www.teamviewer.com/), a remote desktop and support tool, via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows systems. Using Flipper Zeroâ€™s **BadUSB** feature with DuckyScript, it simulates keyboard input to open an elevated Command Prompt and silently install TeamViewer.

> Note: Chocolatey must be pre-installed. Run `install_chocolatey.txt` first if needed.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Save the Script
- Filename: `install_teamviewer.txt`
- Format: UTF-8 plain text

### 2. Upload to Flipper
- Connect Flipper Zero via USB or Bluetooth.
- Use **qFlipper** or **Flipper Mobile App**.
- Transfer to: `SD Card/badusb/`.

### 3. Run the Script
- On Flipper: Navigate to `Main Menu > Bad USB > install_teamviewer.txt`.
- Ensure USB mode is active.
- Connect to the target Windows machine and press **Run**.

The script will:
- Open the Run dialog (`Win + R`).
- Launch an elevated Command Prompt (`cmd` with `CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER`).
- Execute: `choco install teamviewer -y`.

## Installation Verification

TeamViewer installs silently if:
- Chocolatey is installed.
- Administrative privileges are granted.
- An internet connection is available.

Verify installation via: [Chocolatey Package Page](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/teamviewer). Installs the latest stable version (e.g., 15.x as of October 2025).
