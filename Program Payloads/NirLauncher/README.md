Author: SoggyCow  
License: MIT

## Overview

This script automates the installation of **NirLauncher**, a collection of over 200 portable utilities from NirSoft for diagnostics, password recovery, and network monitoring. It uses Flipper Zeroâ€™s **BadUSB** DuckyScript to simulate keyboard input, open an elevated Command Prompt, and perform a silent installation via Chocolatey.

> Note: Chocolatey must be pre-installed on the target system. See `install_chocolatey.txt` for setup if needed.

## Use Case

Ideal for forensic and adversarial workstations requiring lightweight tools for password analysis, system auditing, and utility benchmarking without complex installations.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Save Payload
- File: `install_nirlauncher.txt`
- Encoding: Plain text, UTF-8

### 2. Transfer to Flipper
- Connect Flipper Zero via USB or Bluetooth.
- Use **qFlipper** or **Flipper Mobile App**.
- Upload to: `SD Card/badusb/`

### 3. Launch on Target System
- On Flipper: Navigate to `Main Menu > Bad USB > install_nirlauncher.txt`.
- Ensure USB mode is active.
- Connect to the target Windows machine and select **Run**.

The script will:
- Open the Run dialog (`Win + R`).
- Launch an elevated Command Prompt (`cmd` with `CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER`).
- Execute: `choco install nirlauncher -y`.

## Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10/11
- **Chocolatey**: Must be pre-installed
- **Admin Privileges**: Required for elevated installation
- **Internet Access**: Needed to download the package
- **CMD Compatibility**: Must support Chocolatey commands
- **System Specs**: Lightweight; refer to NirSoft requirements

## Technical Notes

- **Delays**: Uses `DELAY 1000`, `500`, and `1500` ms. Increase for slower systems (e.g., `700+` ms).
- **Silent Install**: The `-y` flag suppresses user prompts.
- **Elevation**: `CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER` may trigger a UAC prompt.
- **Package**: Installs the latest stable NirLauncher version (e.g., 1.x as of October 2025).
- **Security**: Some NirSoft utilities may trigger antivirus flags. Use ethically and with authorization.
- **Testing**: Test in a virtual machine before deployment.
