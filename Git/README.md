## üóÉÔ∏è Overview

This script installs [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a widely-used version control system, via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) on Windows.  
Designed for **Flipper Zero's BadUSB** feature, it uses **DuckyScript** to emulate keystrokes, open an elevated **Command Prompt (CMD)**, and silently deploy Git.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Chocolatey must be pre-installed. Run the Chocolatey installation script before using this module.
