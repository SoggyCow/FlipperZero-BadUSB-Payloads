# FlipperZero BadUSB Scripts  
Crafted by [SoggyCow](https://github.com/SoggyCow)

Welcome to a growing collection of **BadUSB payloads** engineered for [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/). This repository showcases practical, tactical, and occasionally mischievous scripts written to leverage Flipper’s built-in USB emulation capabilities using **Ducky Script**.

## 🧠 Purpose  
Created as a public archive to share my work and contribute useful payloads to the Flipper Zero community. These scripts range from quick demos to more involved utilities designed for adversarial testing and creative automation.

## 📁 Contents  
Each script is stored in its own folder with clear naming. You’ll find:
- 🔐 Brute-force & lock-screen bypass payloads  
- ⚙️ System tweaks, prank scripts, and automation examples  
- 📋 Helpful documentation and usage notes per payload

## 💡 How to Use  
1. Clone or download the repo  
2. Load scripts onto your Flipper Zero (via SD card or USB)  
3. Navigate to **BadUSB > Scripts** and launch

## 📢 Disclaimer  
These scripts are for **educational and research purposes only**. Always have permission before deploying any payload. SoggyCow is not responsible for misuse.

## 📬 Contributions  
Ideas, forks, and pull requests are welcome. If you have a script or improvement, send it in—let’s make this toolbox sharp.

Enjoy the payloads. Hack responsibly.
