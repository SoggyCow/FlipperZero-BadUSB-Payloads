# **FlipperZero BadUSB Scripts**

**Crafted by [SoggyCow](https://github.com/SoggyCow)**

Welcome to a growing collection of **BadUSB payloads** engineered for [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/). This repository showcases practical, tactical, and occasionally mischievous scripts written to leverage Flipper’s built-in USB emulation capabilities using **Ducky Script**.

## **🧠 Purpose**

Created as a public archive to share my work and contribute useful payloads to the Flipper Zero community. These scripts range from quick demos to more involved utilities designed for adversarial testing, creative automation, and software installation.

## **📁 Contents**

Each script is stored in its own folder with clear naming. You’ll find:  
- **🔐 Brute-force & lock-screen bypass payloads**  
- **⚙️ System tweaks, prank scripts, and automation examples**  
- **📦 Software installation scripts** for various applications via Chocolatey  
- **📋 Helpful documentation** and usage notes per payload

## **💡 How to Use**

1. **Clone or Download the Repo**: Download the repository or clone it using `git clone https://github.com/SoggyCow/flipperzero-badusb-scripts.git`.  
2. **Load Scripts onto Flipper Zero**:  
   - Connect your Flipper Zero to a computer via USB or Bluetooth.  
   - Use the qFlipper app or Flipper Mobile app to transfer the desired script(s) to the `SD Card/badusb/` folder.  
3. **Run the Script**:  
   - On Flipper Zero, navigate to **Main Menu > Bad USB**.  
   - Select the script (e.g., `install_7zip.txt`) and ensure USB mode is active (USB logo displayed).  
   - Connect Flipper Zero to the target Windows machine via USB.  
   - Press the **Run** button to execute the script.  
4. **Verify Execution**: Ensure **Chocolatey** is pre-installed on the target system, an internet connection is available, and administrative privileges are granted (most scripts trigger a UAC prompt).

## **📢 Important Notes**

- **Chocolatey Dependency**: All scripts require **Chocolatey** to be pre-installed on the target system. Run the [Chocolatey installation script](https://github.com/SoggyCow/choco-install-script) first.  
- **Package Availability**: Some packages (e.g., `protonpass`, `protondrive`, `quickcpu`, `renamemytvseries2`, `easeus-partition-master`) may not be available in the [Chocolatey Community Repository](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages) as of August 2025. Verify package existence before running these scripts or consider alternative installation methods.  
- **Administrative Privileges**: Most scripts open an elevated CMD, which may trigger a UAC prompt if enabled.  
- **Timing Delays**: Scripts use delays (e.g., `DELAY 1000`, `DELAY 500`) for reliable execution. Adjust delays for slower systems if execution fails.  
- **Testing**: Test scripts in a controlled environment (e.g., a virtual machine) to avoid unintended consequences.  
- **Responsible Use**: Some tools (e.g., `cheatengine`, `nirlauncher`, `ida-free`) may be flagged by antivirus software or have sensitive uses. Use them responsibly and only for legitimate purposes, such as educational or security research activities.
