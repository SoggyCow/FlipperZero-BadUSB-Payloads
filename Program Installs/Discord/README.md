## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Considerations

- **Silent Flag:**  
  `-y` suppresses user prompts during installation

- **Timing Delays:**  
  `DELAY 1000`, `500`, `1500` used for reliability  
  Tune delays (e.g., `DELAY 700+`) for slower hosts

- **Elevation Method:**  
  Simulates `CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER`  
  May trigger UAC prompt (if enabled)

- **Package Check:**  
  Confirms installation of latest stable Discord version (e.g., v1.x as of Aug 2025)  
  Chocolatey page: [discord.install](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/discord.install)

- **Testing Recommendation:**  
  Verify payload in sandbox or VM before live deployment
